**LenoreFin** v{version} was just released!

For anyone new to it: **LenoreFin** began as a simple Excel spreadsheet I used to manage my family's budget. But over time, I realized no existing tools gave me the control, flexibility, and privacy I wanted. So I built **LenoreFin** — a personal finance tracker that puts you in charge.

Designed for self-hosting, **LenoreFin** keeps your financial data completely local, with no third-party syncing or hidden services. It includes tools for tracking cash flow, setting up custom budgets, tagging transactions, planning for retirement or big purchases, getting bill reminders, and even forecasting account balances. Whether you're budgeting for groceries or planning a 10-year savings goal, **LenoreFin** helps you see the full picture—on your terms.

#### Key Features:
- **Budgets** - Setup budgets for things like groceries to track expenses over time.
- **Cash Flow** - See where your money has been and where its going.
- **Retirement Planning** - Plan for retirment.
- **Reminders** - Setup recurring transactions as reminders for bills.
- **Account Forecasts** - Predict and see what the future of your finances will look like over the coming months or years.
